# discord-ID-reversal
Look up any discord tag with a user id
Currently, my reversal program does not take use of the JSON format, but it exists.
(You will have to add a bot token in the php file if you want to set it up on your own web server)

Virus total for the EXE https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3b8b6363edab4eb6e2362fbe0b106f6d85649650690d00a3bf04761477a9a10c/detection
if you don't trust it, build the program yourself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
